# Vehicle-Detection-Classification-and-Counting
This repository makes use of YOLO pre-trained model to classify, and count the vehicles.
The project was inspired by the github repo: https://github.com/AarohiSingla/Track-and-Count-Using-yolov9
The repository contains only one way of count, but I have modified it to count for vehicles moving in both direction and added the features of counting and classifying the vehicles.
Here are some snipshots from output:
